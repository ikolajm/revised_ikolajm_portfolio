                    <p>I am a web developer able to help build solid digital experiences. I'm highly adaptable, detail-oriented, and constantly trying to approach problems with empathy for both the user and team involved. I graduated from Eleven Fifty Academy in 2019, and since then I have been trusted to assist in the design and development of various projects to solve problems.</p>

                    <p className="list-intro">Recently, I've been spending some time with the following technologies:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Asp.NET CORE</span></li>
                        <li><span>SignalR</span></li>
                        <li><span>Django</span></li>
                        <li><span>Scrapy</span></li>
                        <li><span>AWS <span>(S3, RDS, Beanstalk)</span></span></li>
                        <li><span>Azure <span>(Storage Accounts, App Services)</span></span></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>When I'm not working, I have a variety of interests that keep me away from my keyboard - I like to get outside and be active when I can. I love running, pick up basketball and riding my skateboard! More recently, I've been trying my hand at playing the guitar and digital art. I get a lot of enjoyment from activities that I can experience and share with others!</p>
